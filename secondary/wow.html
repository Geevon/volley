            <h2>Why Core Skills Matter</h2>
            <p>Mastering the core volleyball skills lays the foundation for becoming a strong player. Each skill plays a critical role during a game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Starts each play and can put the opponent at a disadvantage if done strategically.</li>
                <li><strong>Receiving:</strong> The first line of defense after a serve; sets up the team's offensive play.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Acts like the "quarterback" of the team, setting up hitters for attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Hitting:</strong> The primary way to score points by spiking the ball into the opponent's court.</li>
                <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> The first defensive action to stop opponent spikes right at the net.</li>
                <li><strong>Digging:</strong> Saves the ball after a powerful spike, keeping the play alive and allowing a counterattack.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By practicing these core skills consistently, players develop the control, agility, and strategy needed to succeed on the court.</p>
